## echo

This is a useful command that parrots what you type back to the screen
```shell
$ echo Hello World
Hello World
```


## Taking notes / comments in bash

To add a note while on the command line, preface your note with the
`#` character.  You can do this on the whole line, or after a command
before hitting return.

```shell
$ #This is a commment, whole line is ignored
$ echo Hello #Everything from here on is ignored
Hello
$ # Output remained
```
