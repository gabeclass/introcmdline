<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>These are reference materials for the PiCSciE <em>virtual</em> workshop <strong>Intro to the Linux Command Line</strong> at Princeton. Most of this material is covered interactively and adapted as much as possible to the audience at any given workshop.</p>
<!--- At the start of the workshop, participants will see how to
capture every command they type, along with the output and any notes
and comments -- **everyone will have a personalized record of what
happens in the session.** Consequently, very little is posted on this
page. -->

<p>This workshop does not assume prior experience with Linux/Unix systems or the bash shell, nor does it assume that you have previously worked with a command-line interface (CLI) to a computer.</p>
<h2 id="adroit">Adroit</h2>
<p>The workshop <em>does</em> assume that you have an account on the Adroit cluster (a shared Linux cluster at Princeton on which we will do our work during the workshop) <em>and</em> that you can access Adroit via SSH. The PICSciE website offers <a href="https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/education/training/virtual-workshop-requirements">instructions</a> for how to connect via SSH.</p>
<p>NOTE that connecting to Adroit (or to the web interface MyAdroit described below) requires that you be on the Princeton <strong>eduroam</strong> network if connecting from on-campus (the <strong>puvisitor</strong> network will <em>not</em> allow a connection to Adroit) or on a <a href="https://princeton.service-now.com/snap?id=kb_article&amp;sys_id=ce2a27064f9ca20018ddd48e5210c745">Princeton VPN</a> (if connecting from off-campus) or . In either case (on- or off-campus), you must be able to Duo authenticate when prompted.</p>
<h3 id="myadroit-web-interface">MyAdroit web interface</h3>
<p>Adroit also offers a web interface called <a href="https://myadroit.princeton.edu/"><strong>MyAdroit</strong></a> that provides a command-line shell plus a graphical file browser. However, <strong><em>MyAdroit is not recommended for this workshop</em></strong>, since some of the keyboard shortcuts we will be using do not work via the web interface. Please use MyAdroit only if you have no other way to connect to the Adroit cluster.</p>
<!--If MyAdroit is your only alternative for connecting to Adroityou
must be on the Princeton **eduroam** network (the **puvisitor**
network will *not* allow a connection to Adroit), and you must be able
to Duo authenticate. If you were off campus, you would be establish a
connection to Princeton's VPN first.  OIT has
[instructions](https://princeton.service-now.com/snap?id=kb_article&sys_id=ce2a27064f9ca20018ddd48e5210c745)
for how to do that.

<h2 id="warnings"><strong>WARNINGS!</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Linux is <em>case-sensitive</em></strong> (Windows and macOS, in contrast, are usually case-<em>insensitive</em>, depending on how your hard drive's filesystem was configured).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The command-line is <em>unforgiving</em>!</strong> Type things <em>EXACTLY</em> as you see them, and avoid interpreting (and don't assume the computer will interpret anything for you -- be precise).</p></li>

## About Makefile
I update the documentation directory using a Makefile to sync src/ and docs/, with
the 'Dinky' theme because its seemed apropros of Princeton. To run it, just run
`make` from the repo root.
