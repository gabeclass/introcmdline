# SSH

There are two important conveniences that you can incorporate into
your SSH process:

* eliminating the need to type your login password (using SSH keys)

* creating ssh-specific aliases that remember login information and
  other ssh command-line options for every machine you log into (using
  the `.ssh/config` file)
  
The setup can vary a little bit between operating systems, so we will
discuss the overarching ideas and include some helpful links for you
to follow later.
